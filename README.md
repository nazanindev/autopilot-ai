# `flow`

Personal AI dev harness. Each task gets an isolated worktree and runs `plan → execute → verify → ship` automatically.

Includes sub-agent spawn guardrails, cost controls, context management, and observability metrics + dashboard.

**Demo:** [Six games in 10 minutes](https://github.com/nazanindev/ai_1.0) — each one a parallel agent, each one its own pipeline.

## What it does

You type a task. `flow` spins up an isolated git worktree, runs it through a full `plan → execute → verify → ship` pipeline, and opens a PR — without you touching it again. Multiple tasks run in parallel. The TUI shows all of them.

```
[1] plan    ── Architecture question        (Opus)
[2] execute ── Rate limiting impl           (Sonnet)  step 8/40
[3] ship    ── PR opened: .../pull/42
```

---

## How it works

Limits live in `constraints.yaml` and are enforced by a pre-tool hook that runs before every agent action — not in a system prompt. The agent can't reason past them.

**Weighted step budgets.** Every tool call has a cost: `Agent: 5.0`, `Write: 2.0`, `Edit: 1.5`, `Read: 0.25`. Each phase has a budget — plan: 15, execute: 40, verify: 15, ship: 8. When it's spent, the hook blocks.

**Spend gates.** API utility calls are gated at `$1.00` by default. Configurable per project.

**Model routing.** Opus plans, Sonnet executes, Haiku reviews and writes commit messages. Routing is in `routing.yaml` with per-keyword overrides — prefix a task with `architecture:` or `quick:` to change the model without touching config.

**Auto-remediation.** If verify fails, a fix worker spawns, retries up to twice, then surfaces the failure if it can't resolve it.

## Install

```sh
pip install -e .
flow init
```

`flow init` writes hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json` and creates `~/.autopilot/.env`:

```sh
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # for ship, check, ci-review
AP_PLAN=pro                    # pro | max5 | max20 | api_only
```

---

## Usage

```sh
flow
```

Type a task, press Enter. Prefix to route it:

| Prefix | Model | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| _(none)_ | Sonnet | Full pipeline: plan → execute → verify → ship, reviewer auto-spawned |
| `plan: <question>` | Opus | Interactive planner — stays alive, responds to follow-ups |
| `review: <branch>` | Haiku | One-shot diff review |

### Commands

| | |
|---|---|
| `/view N` | Drill into session N — full output + live input |
| `/stop [N]` | Stop session N or all running |
| `/prompt N <msg>` | Inject a message into session N |
| `/model opus\|sonnet\|haiku` | Override model for new sessions |
| `/resume [run_id]` | Reattach to an interrupted run |
| `/quit` | Exit, clean up completed worktrees |

Planner sessions show `?` in the pane title when waiting for input.

## CI / scripting

```sh
flow doctor [--fix]          # check hook health
flow stats                   # cost by project
flow ship                    # verify → commit → PR
flow check                   # AI review of local diff
flow ci-review --pr 42       # for GitHub Actions
```
